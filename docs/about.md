# About Me

I'm a software developer based in Ireland.

I have a weblog called [Can't Hack It](https://i.canthack.it/), where I try to force myself to actually write stuff. Historically, I hosted all my contents under [talideon.com](https://talideon.com/), but that now serves primarily as the root domain for naming my servers. I have far too many domain names.
