Hi! This site exists solely for me to mess with Pelican and Github Pages.
There's nothing interesting here, though I might start listing my projects
at some point.

For further links to stuff, my main website is Stereochrome_, but I also have a
weblog called `Can't Hack It`_, where I try to force myself to actually write
stuff. Historically, I hosted all my contents under talideon.com_, but that now
serves primarily as the root domain for naming my servers.
