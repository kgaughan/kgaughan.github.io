<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p>Hi! This site exists solely for me to mess with Pelican and Github Pages.
There's nothing interesting here, though I might start listing my projects
at some point.</p>
<p>For further links to stuff, my main website is <a class="reference external" href="https://stereochro.me/">Stereochrome</a>, but I also have a
weblog called <a class="reference external" href="https://i.canthack.it/">Can't Hack It</a>, where I try to force myself to actually write
stuff. Historically, I hosted all my contents under <a class="reference external" href="https://talideon.com/">talideon.com</a>, but that now
serves primarily as the root domain for naming my servers.</p>
